This directory have the power table and power_selection.conf files for different platform configurations.

For QTN devices, there are 2 directories which are used to store power tables -- "/proc/bootcfg/" and "/etc/power_tables/", the former is in uboot config block and it is independent of image, the latter is built into image.
Since there are two places for power tables, to search for the target power table, we defined 4 kinds of power selection mode which define the sequence of searching, as below,

0 - Search for the target power table in "/proc/bootcfg/" only, it is the default mode.
1 - Search for the target power table in "/proc/bootcfg/" at first, if not find, then search for the target power table in "/etc/power_tables/";
2 - Search for the target power table in "/etc/power_tables/" at first, if not find, then search for the target power table in "/proc/bootcfg/";
3 - Search for the target power table in "/etc/power_tables/" only;

In addition, RFIC6x/RFIC622x systems now allow setting an optional configurable power table location (this will support customers
with nonstandard power table values).  This can be set using the call_qcsapi "reg_chan_txpower_path_set" command -

Example: "call_qcsapi reg_chan_txpower_path_set wifi0 /mnt/jffs2/local_txpower/" would set "/mnt/jffs2/local_txpower" as
the local path.

If the local path is set, there are two additional power selection modes:

4 - Search for the target power table in the local path first, then search in "/etc/power_tables/"
5 - Search for the target power table in the local path only;

A local path may be defined at the u-boot command line - by default, nothing is set, but a path may be added by
"set power_table_path PATH" - for example "set power_table_path /mnt/jffs2/local_txpower/" would set the default
to "/mnt/jffs2/local_txpower".  If "power_table_path" is not defined in the u-boot environment, or if no power table
files are found in the specific location, the default files at "/etc/power_tables/" will be used if power selection
mode 4 is selected.

Although an alternative path may be defined in the boot environment, it is not applied until call_qcsapi is called.
To make matters easier, a new script has been added, "set_txpower_path".

"set_txpower_path" or "set_txpower_path 0" will read the value given in the boot environment and set it as the optional
file path.

"set_txpower_path 0 /mnt/jffs2/another_local_directory/" would set "/mnt/jffs2/another_local_directory" as the local path

To set the power selection mode as "x", please define "power_selection=x" in power_table.conf which locates in SDK directory "power_tables/<board_config>/".

For the name of power table, it must be one of below two formats,

tx_power_QSR1000_<region>.txt
tx_power_QSR1000_sta_<region>.txt (for STA mode only)

For example,

tx_power_QSR1000_us.txt
tx_power_QSR1000_eu.txt
tx_power_QSR1000_sta_us.txt
tx_power_QSR1000_sta_eu.txt


Note:

The power tables in original SDK are for QTN RDK boards, if you want to enable the power tables in "/etc/power_tables/", please replace them with your power tables which match your boards.
